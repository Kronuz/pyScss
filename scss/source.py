class SourceFile(object):
    """A single input file to be fed to the compiler.  Detects the encoding
    (according to CSS spec rules) and performs some light pre-processing.

    This class is mostly internal and you shouldn't have to worry about it.

    Source files are uniquely identified by their ``.key``, a 2-tuple of
    ``(origin, relpath)``.

    ``origin`` is an object from the compiler's search
    path, most often a directory represented by a :class:`pathlib.Path`.
    ``relpath`` is a relative path from there to the actual file, again usually
    a ``Path``.

    The idea here is that source files don't always actually come from the
    filesystem, yet import semantics are expressed in terms of paths.  By
    keeping the origin and relative path separate, it's possible for e.g.
    Django to swap in an object that has the ``Path`` interface, but actually
    looks for files in an arbitrary storage backend.  In that case it would
    make no sense to key files by their absolute path, as they may not exist on
    disk or even on the same machine.  Also, relative imports can then continue
    to work, because they're guaranteed to only try the same origin.

    The ``origin`` may thus be anything that implements a minimal ``Path``ish
    interface (division operator, ``.parent``, ``.resolve()``).  It may also be
    ``None``, indicating that the file came from a string or some other origin
    that can't usefully produce other files.

    ``relpath``, however, should always be a ``Path``. or string.  XXX only when origin  (There's little
    advantage to making it anything else.)  A ``relpath`` may **never** contain
    ".."; there is nothing above the origin.

    Note that one minor caveat of this setup is that it's possible for the same
    file on disk to be imported under two different names (even though symlinks
    are always resolved), if directories in the search path happen to overlap.
