pyScss is a compiler for the `Sass`_ language, a superset of CSS3 that adds
programming capabilities and some other syntactic sugar.

.. _Sass: http://sass-lang.com/

Quickstart
----------

You need Python 2.7 or 3.3+.  PyPy is also supported.

Installation:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pyScss

Usage:

.. code-block:: console

    python -mscss < style.scss

Python API:

.. code-block:: python

    from scss import Compiler
    Compiler().compile_string("a { color: red + green; }")


Features
--------

95% of Sass 3.2 is supported.  If it's not supported, it's a bug!  Please file
a ticket.

Most of Compass 0.11 is also built in.


Further reading
---------------

Documentation is in Sphinx.  You can build it yourself by running ``make html``
from within the ``docs`` directory, or read it on RTD:
http://pyscss.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

The canonical syntax reference is part of the Ruby Sass documentation:
